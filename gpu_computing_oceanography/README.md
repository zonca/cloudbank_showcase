# GPU Computing in Oceanography on Google Cloud

This project showcases the use of cloud resources for scientific computing, specifically focusing on GPU-accelerated oceanographic simulations using Julia. The goal is to demonstrate how cloud infrastructure can effectively solve scientific problems with a streamlined workflow.

## Overview

The showcase consists of two main components:

### 1. Single-Instance Multi-GPU Julia Simulation
A high-performance simulation designed to run on a single Google Cloud instance equipped with multiple GPUs. 

*   **Duration:** Approximately 1 hour.
*   **Objective:** To provide a scientifically relevant yet accessible example of GPU acceleration in oceanography.
*   **Contents:** 
    *   Environment setup instructions.
    *   A single script to execute the simulation.

### 2. Data Analysis & Visualization
A Jupyter Notebook environment for analyzing the simulation output.

*   **Environment:** Google Cloud instance with Julia and Conda.
*   **Function:** Loads the data produced by the simulation and generates visualizations.
*   **Output:** High-quality plots demonstrating the simulation results.
